############ Big O
Big O is used to formalize counting. It allow us to express how the runtime of algorithm grows with the input


############ Binary Search
Binary search is a search technique use to find element in a collection
(binary search only works on sorted collection of element)
    steps:
        1. Initialize 2 pointers, start at the beginning of array, end at the end of array
        2. Find the element at the middle of the two pointers
        3. If element at the middle is bigger than our goal, set the end pointer to middle
        4. If the element at the middle is smaller than our goal, we set the start pointer to middle + 1
        #note: to get the middle is: start pointer + end pointer / 2 (floor math )
